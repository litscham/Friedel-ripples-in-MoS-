# Literature Review: Electronic Structure of MoS₂

## Objective
Deep dive into MoS₂ crystal structure, band structure, and electronic properties

## Tasks
- Document MoS₂ crystal structure and symmetry (2H phase)
- Review band structure calculations from literature
- Study direct bandgap properties in monolayers
- Investigate spin-orbit coupling effects
- Compare with other TMD materials

## Deliverable
MoS₂ electronic properties section with figures and tables

## Labels
`literature-review` `phase1` `mos2` `electronic-structure`

## Priority
High
