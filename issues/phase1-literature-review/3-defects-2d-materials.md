# Literature Review: Defects in 2D Materials

## Objective
Comprehensive review of point defects and their characterization

## Tasks
- Classify defect types: vacancies, antisites, adatoms
- Study formation energies and thermodynamics
- Review defect-induced state localization
- Document experimental defect imaging techniques
- Analyze charge state effects on defect properties

## Deliverable
Defects section with classification and properties table

## Labels
`literature-review` `phase1` `defects` `2d-materials`

## Priority
High
