\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Objective}
Comprehensive review of point defects and their STEM-EELS characterization.

\section{Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Classify defect types: vacancies, antisites, adatoms
    \item Study formation energies and thermodynamics
    \item Review defect-induced state localization
    \item Document experimental defect imaging techniques
    \item Analyze charge state effects on defect properties
\end{itemize}

\section{Deliverable}
Defects section with classification, properties table, and STEM-EELS characterization capabilities.
