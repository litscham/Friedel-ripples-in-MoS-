# Theoretical Framework: Quantum Scattering Theory

## Objective
Develop mathematical framework for electron-defect scattering

## Tasks
- Derive Friedel sum rule from first principles
- Work through phase shift calculations
- Develop Born approximation treatment
- Apply to 2D electron systems
- Document perturbation theory approach

## Deliverable
Theory chapter section with derivations and equations

## Labels
`theory` `phase1` `scattering-theory` `mathematical-framework`

## Priority
High
