# Theory: Green's Functions and LDOS Calculation

## Objective
Master Green's function approach for computing LDOS in 2D defect systems

## Tasks
- Study free electron Green's function
- Derive retarded/advanced propagators in 2D
- Apply to defect potential perturbations
- Calculate local density of states (LDOS) via Green's functions
- Document Fourier transform relationships

## Deliverable
Detailed mathematical framework with Green's function relations

## Labels
`theory` `phase1` `greens-function` `mathematical-framework` `ldos`

## Priority
