# Computational: S Vacancy Defects (LDOS and Comparison)

## Objective
Complete DFT study of S vacancies with comparative LDOS analysis for STEM-EELS application

## Tasks
- Create supercells with S vacancies (single and double)
- Optimize atomic geometry
- Calculate electronic structure
- Map LDOS around vacancy sites
- Analyze local charge redistribution
- Compare with Mo vacancy effects

## Deliverable
S vacancy results: geometries, electronic structures, comparative LDOS maps

## Labels
`computational` `phase2` `defects` `s-vacancy` `ldos` `comparison`

## Priority
High
