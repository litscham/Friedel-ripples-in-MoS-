# Computational: Antisite Defects (LDOS Characterization)

## Objective
Study Mo-S and S-Mo antisite defects with detailed LDOS characterization for STEM-EELS signatures

## Tasks
- Create supercells with antisite substitutions
- Optimize geometries with symmetry variations
- Calculate band structures and DOS
- Map LDOS for both defect types
- Analyze hybridization effects
- Compare with vacancy-induced changes

## Deliverable
Antisite defect results: structures, electronic properties, LDOS visualizations

## Labels
`computational` `phase2` `defects` `antisite` `ldos` `hybridization`

## Priority
High
