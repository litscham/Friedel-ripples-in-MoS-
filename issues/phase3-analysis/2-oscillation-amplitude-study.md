# Analysis: Oscillation Amplitude and Decay (STEM-EELS Detectability)

## Objective
Characterize amplitude and spatial decay of Friedel ripples for STEM-EELS observability

## Tasks
- Quantify LDOS oscillation amplitudes
- Analyze decay with distance from defect
- Study amplitude dependence on defect strength
- Compare with theoretical models
- Document amplitude vs energy relationships

## Deliverable
Amplitude analysis plots and functional relationships
