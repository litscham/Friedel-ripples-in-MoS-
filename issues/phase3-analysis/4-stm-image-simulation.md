# Analysis: STEM-EELS Simulation

## Objective
Generate simulated STEM-EELS spectra and maps from computed LDOS

## Tasks
- Implement STEM imaging simulator for ADF (Annular Dark Field) contrast
- Implement EELS simulator for core-loss and low-loss spectroscopy
- Convert LDOS to simulated STEM-EELS signals
- Vary electron probe energy and collection angles
- Compare simulated signals with theoretical predictions
- Generate publication-quality figure sets with energy-filtered maps

## Deliverable
Simulated STEM-EELS images and spectra for all defect types

## Labels
`analysis` `phase3` `stem-eels-simulation` `visualization` `experimental-comparison`

## Priority
