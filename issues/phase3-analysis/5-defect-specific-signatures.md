# Analysis: Defect-Specific Signatures

## Objective
Identify unique electronic signatures for defect identification

## Tasks
- Compare LDOS patterns across defect types
- Identify differentiating features (wavelength, symmetry, amplitude)
- Study charge state effects on signatures
- Create decision tree for experimental defect identification
- Document distinguishing characteristics

## Deliverable
Comprehensive comparison table and signature schematic diagrams

## Labels
`analysis` `phase3` `defect-signatures` `characterization` `comparison`

## Priority
High
