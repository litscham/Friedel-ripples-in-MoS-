# Analysis: Comparison with Scattering Theory

## Objective
Validate DFT results against theoretical predictions

## Tasks
- Calculate expected oscillations from scattering theory
- Compare theoretical predictions with DFT LDOS
- Analyze discrepancies (if any)
- Study effective scattering potential from DFT
- Document agreement/disagreement metrics

## Deliverable
Theory vs computation comparison figures and quantitative analysis

## Labels
`analysis` `phase3` `validation` `theory-comparison` `scattering-theory`

## Priority
