# Experimental Implications: STEM-EELS Detection Feasibility

## Objective
Assess experimental observability of Friedel ripples via STEM-EELS

## Tasks
- Analyze required STEM spatial resolution for ripple imaging
- Study electron beam energy effects on contrast
- Estimate signal-to-noise requirements for EELS measurements
- Review experimental STEM-EELS capabilities in literature
- Propose optimal experimental conditions (beam energy, collection angle, dwell time)
- Compare detection feasibility across different STEM operation modes

## Deliverable
Experimental feasibility assessment document with recommendations and technical specifications

## Labels
`experimental` `phase4` `stem-eels` `feasibility-study`

## Priority
High
