# Comparison Study: Friedel Oscillations in Other 2D Materials (STEM-EELS Perspective)

## Objective
Compare with Friedel oscillations in graphene, WS₂, and other TMDs, assessing STEM-EELS characterization potential

## Tasks
- Collect data on other 2D TMDs if available
- Compare with graphene studies
- Analyze material-specific effects
- Document material parameter influences
- Create unified 2D materials comparison

## Deliverable
Cross-material comparison table and analysis

## Labels
`analysis` `phase4` `comparison` `2d-materials` `literature-review`

## Priority
Lower
