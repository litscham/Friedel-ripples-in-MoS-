\maketitle

\section{Objective}
Present DFT and STEM-EELS simulation findings clearly and comprehensively.

\section{Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Organize results logically (pristine \textrightarrow~defects \textrightarrow~analysis)
    \item Create high-quality figures with proper captions
    \item Present data tables with key metrics
    \item Write clear descriptive text for each result
    \item Ensure consistent notation and terminology
    \item Include both DFT LDOS and STEM-EELS simulated signals
\end{itemize}

\section{Deliverable}
Complete results chapter (4000--5000 words) with 15--20 figures including STEM-EELS simulations.
